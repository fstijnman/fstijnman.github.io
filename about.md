# About

Hi, my name is Folkert. Folkert is a weird Dutch name (with Germanic origin?) that unfortunately doesn't work well internationally.

I work as a machine learning engineer that enjoys building tangible stuff that generates value.

I write about:

- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning
- MLOps
- Data engineering
- Explainable AI
- Business strategy on all of the above

Other things I enjoy:

- Long distance triathlons (IM 70.3)
- Piano
- Factorio
